I would only suggest to give the option to place icon on desktop or on the taskbar, but not on your every browsing screen. But secondly, we are in the process of developing our new interactive AI Health platform. I would like to get more details about: 1. your API keys packages. 2. your 'Enterprise' package, particularly; - Custom AI modes - Unlimited queries - Custom integrations Looking forward to hearing back from you on how your Multion AI generative agent with API tools can be integrated with our business model.

I've had some issues with the base model, especially with constant looping.

One of the concerns is that your Multion logo floats on my screen while browsing. This feels a bit intrusive in not being able to opt out of it being affixed to one's desktop screen. I would only suggest to give the option to place icon on desktop or on the taskbar, but not on your every browsing screen. But secondly, we are in the process of developing our new interactive AI Health platform. I would like to get more details about: 1. your API keys packages. 2. your 'Enterprise' package, particularly; - Custom AI modes - Unlimited queries - Custom integrations Looking forward to hearing back from you on how your Multion AI generative agent with API tools can be integrated with our business model.
